# What is this?

Someone asked question on #symfony IRC on freenet, so I created this repository to solve that.

```bash
17:23 < caliel> good morning #symfony
17:24 < caliel> I have a table "Images", a table "Slider" and a table "SliderImages", which is an association between $sliders and $images
17:24 < caliel> How can I select, in a controller, to get "Images" that are not in the "SliderImages" of the "Slider" ?
17:24 < caliel> dunno if I wrote correctly
```
